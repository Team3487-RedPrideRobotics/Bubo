         * You're goal here is to take an input list of numbers and sort them.
         * For example, if I made input = {4,2,7}, then output should be {2,4,7}
         * 
         * The two main methods you'll need are input.get(i) and output.add(x)
         * 
         * For input.get(i), 'i' is the index of the item you want (starting with 0)
         * So for example, if input = {4,2,7}, then input.get(0) = 4, and input.get(2) = 7
         * 
         * For output.add(x), x is the value you want to add to output
         * For example, imagine that output = {6}. If you call output.add(1), NOW output = {6,1}
         * 
         * To help you get started, here's a small hint:
         * You'll need to loop through input at least once, so a 'for' loop is a good place to start
         * 
         * You can tell when everything is working by running the tests in SorterTest.java
         * You can also look at that code to see what isn't working yet
